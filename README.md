# Password-Generator
Hello! So this is a password application I created for an employee at my office. They wanted an application that would randomly generate a password that meets a certain criteria and give them greater security. When the user clicks the button to generate a password they are presented with a prompt that makes them chosse the character length for their password. After choosing the character lenght the user is then presented with a series of prompts for password criteria they would like to include in their password. The user has some flexibilty with what they want to include, they are only required to choose one of the character conditions. Once the user chooses the criteria they would like to include, their inputs will be validated and to make sure that at least one character type is selected. After all prompts are answered then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria. The password is then displayed to the page.
